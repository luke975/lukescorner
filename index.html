<h2>Welcome to Luke's Corner of Chaos!</h2>
<p class="border3">Luke's corner of chaos is my website/blog where I post every friday (most of the time). I hope you enjoy it here!</p>

<h2>Style V2</h2>
<p class="border2">Style V2 adds the background, boxes, and new Header 2 & 3 fonts!</p>

<h2>Style V1.1</h2>
<p class="border1">Style V1.1 is more experimenting: I'm taking V1 and doing more stuff with it. Also I need more posts to
experiment with more cool borders.</p>

<h1 style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen">the blogs</h1>

<h2>2/17/2025 - Windows XP</h2>
<p class="border3">As outdated as it is, Windows XP is still great. No its not nostaliga (I never used/liked it until a year ago.). But I think its just good for old hardware.
"bUt lUkE! yOuR gOiNg tO gEt a vIrUs gOiNg oNlInE!1!". Ever heard of your router? It has a built in firewall. Your routers firewall protects you from viruses. So if you are online
on XP and use common sense, you will be A-OK! And you can actually still do a lot of things on it! From legally obtaining game backups and using them, to browsing the web,
to legally (no sarcasm this time) playing old minecraft! And, you can also still use Windows Messenger and AOL Instant Messenger using <a href="http://legacy.escargot.chat">escargot</a>
 and <a href="http://legacy.nina.chat">nina.chat</a> to connect to their servers and re-activate the programs! Isn't that cool?!</p>

<h2>2/16/2025 - Lego</h2>
<p class="border2">Legos. We all know what Legos are, right? Well I was making a Lego set today. And then I thought about why I never play with Legos anymore.
I have no clue why I stopped having an urge to do stuff with legos. I mean, they're cool and all, but I just dont feel like making Lego sets anymore. Am I the only one
with this feeling? I have no clue. That's really all the blog is today. Send blog suggestions to thejukebokx3737@gmail.com</p>

<h2>2/15/2025 - Why Sams is great</h2>
<p class="border1">Ever heard of sams? You know, costco's competitor? Well im gonna tell you why they're so great.
It's because of their food. Their hot-dog combo is ONLY $1.38!! Thats less than Costco's famous $1.50 hot dog meal!!
Also Sams Club food is really cheap.</p>
<h3>Costco Advantagess (2/15/2025)</h3>
<p class="border3">Costco has a few advantages though. Their pizza slice is bigger than Sams 2 pizza slices, and costs less.
Also their pumpkin & apple pie is infinitally better. But I think Sams advantages outwieghs Costco's advantages
Thats why I think Sams is better than Costco.</p>

   
<h2>2/14/2025 - first blog!</h2>
<p class="border2">This is the first blog post! Im currently following an online tutorial about learning CSS, incase if you dont know about
this fancy stuff, CSS is like the decoration to a bland boring home. Thats a good explanation. But yes I will definitally
make a blog post tommorow. Cya later!</p>
