<h2 class="center">Welcome to Luke's Corner of Chaos!</h2>
<p class="center">Luke's corner of chaos is my website/blog where I post every friday (most of the time). I hope you enjoy it here!</p>

<h2>Style V1.1</h2>
<p class="border3">Style V1.1 is more experimenting: I'm taking V1 and doing more stuff with it. Also I need more posts to
experiment with more cool borders.</p>

<h2>Style V1</h2>
<p class="border2">Style V1 is the style you're seeing as of 2/14/25. It will most likely change very soon.</p>

<h2>2/14/2025 - first blog!</h2>
<p class="border1">This is the first blog post! Im currently following an online tutorial about learning CSS, incase if you dont know about
this fancy stuff, CSS is like the decoration to a bland boring home. Thats a good explanation. But yes I will definitally
make a blog post tommorow. Cya later!</p>
