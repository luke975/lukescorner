# This is Lukes Corner of Chaos
The backup version, that is.
Lukes Corner of Chaos has a backup site in case anything happenes to it. The backup site is the original GitHub repo, aka THIS site.
# Anything different?
Yes, actually. Because Neocities has a 5gb file limit and will only support only files to be uploaded, I made the file library on the backup site (this site) so now you can download various things I upload!
