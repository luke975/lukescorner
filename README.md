# This is Luke's Corner of Chaos
Luke's corner of chaos is my website where I usually post blog posts every monday.
Since it's in the development phase, im probably gonna post a blog everyday.

# Update
We're going to move to Neocities so our site can get more exposure. We're also going to be styling the page differently, and having more cool stuff!
