# This is Lukes Corner of Chaos
The backup version, that is.
Lukes Corner of Chaos has a backup site in case anything happenes to it. The backup site is the original GitHub repo, aka THIS site.
# Anything different?
Yes, actually. Because Neocities has a 5gb file limit and will only support only files to be uploaded, I made the file library on the backup site (this site) so now you can download various things I upload!
# Naming Scheme
Each backup is a .7z file. Each of these files are named. Here is the naming scheme: backupMM-DD-YY HHMIMI(TZ) , where M = Month, D = Day, Y = Year, H = Hour, MI = Minute, and TZ = Time Zone. For example, backup8-28-25 1416EDT means that the backup was made on August 28th, 2025 at 14:16 / 2:16 PM in the Eastern Daylight Time timezone.
